<h1 align="left">Welcome to my GitHub Profile!</h1>

###

I’ve moved my recreational coding to  [my Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/hugo-russeil).

I’ve always valued GitHub as a place to tinker and learn, but lately, the platform feels less like a tool and more like a product pushing its own agenda. The way AI features (like Copilot) are now woven into every part of the workflow; default reviewers, auto-generated commit messages, Copilot PRs, makes it feel less like an option and more like an expectation. I miss the feeling of choosing my own tools, not having them chosen for me.

More broadly, I’m looking for a space that isn’t shaped by corporate priorities, where the focus stays on people, not metrics or monetisation.
